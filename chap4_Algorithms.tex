\section{Primary implemenation} 
done.
\section{Runtime data locality optimization}
Two-level locality collective optimization in runtime. Done. 

\section{Optimizing team structure}
[In progress]
\subsection{Reduce the data structure size}
\begin{itemize}
\item Memory alignment
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Distributed member mapping list}

\section{Extensions}
[in progress]
\subsection{Gather/Scatter collective operations}
\subsection{Node team}
Node team is a kind of teams runtime constructs for users. A node team represent a collect of processes that share the same `Node', usually means they shared the same memory. This can be useful for users to implement better program with considering the data locality.
