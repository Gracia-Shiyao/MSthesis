Two-level locality collective optimization in runtime. Done. 

\section{Optimizing Team Structure}
[In progress]
\subsection{Reduce the data structure size}
\begin{itemize}
\item Memory alignment

\subsection{Non-blocking Team Construct}
\subsection{Node Team}
Node team is a kind of teams runtime constructs for users. A node team represent a collect of processes that share the same `Node', usually means they shared the same memory. This can be useful for users to implement better program with considering the data locality.
