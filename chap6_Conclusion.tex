\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:Conclusion}

During this thesis, we have describe the implemenation and optimizations we develope in our runtime and compiler to support the addtional parallel features listed in the Fortran language Technical Specification Draft. Our focus is on the \textit{team} construct and collective procedures. The contribution of this work are summerized as following:
\begin{itemize}
\item We developed the first implementation of the anticipated team features expected to be added to Fortran 2015, in addition to implementing support for collective. We demostrated the effectiveness of these new features in the CG benchmark from the NAS Parallel Benchmark suite
\item We evaluate the language features using the microbenchmark to show the effectiveness of these new features.
